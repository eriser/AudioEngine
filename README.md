# AudioEngine

The AudioEngine is a simple console application that provides real-time audio processing of Lua code generated by [Vult](https://github.com/modlfo/vult). The AudioEngine acts as a server that can communicate with different clients.

For more information refer to the [VultPlatform](https://github.com/modlfo/VultPlatform/wiki) wiki.

# Status

This project is in early stages of development and it will evolve, therefore the API are unstable.

# Using

The AudioClient is intended to work with the (coming soon) AudioClient.

# Install

This application uses [JUCE](https://www.juce.com), therefore you need to have all the dependencies to build and use JUCE applications.

To build the project you have to follow theses steps.
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make install
```

By default, the executable is installed in the source-directory/install.

When building for windows is recommended to use instead
```
$ cmake ../ -G "NMake Makefiles"
$ nmake install
```

This project uses:
- [JUCE](https://www.juce.com)
- [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org)
